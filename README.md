# Description of the assignment
In this assignment we have a total of 5 different scenes that use Java Processing.
The song we chose for this assignment is "starryeyed" by Ellie Goulding. We felt this song gave us good oppurtunties to create a narrative within our video and of course gave us many visualization oppurtunites. All of our visualisations respond to the amplitude and frequency of the music, this is doen through the minim library.

----
# Instructions
- Compile and run main.java from ie.tudublin package
- In order of appearance = {Scene1(Cian), Scene2(Ian), Scene3(Cian & Ian), Scene4(Joshua), Scene5(Joshua), , Scene1(Cian)}
----
# How it works
- Each team member has its own directory containing the visualisations. 
- Aggregate file GroupVisual.java is used to run the visualisations, initialise the music, create the objects and call the methods from the visualisations. This file has been moved to ie.tudublin package for convenience.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
